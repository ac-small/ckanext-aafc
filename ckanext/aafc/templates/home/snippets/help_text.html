<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h5>Q: Why create an AAFC Data Catalogue?</h5> 

<p>A: The AAFC Data Catalogue was established to create a centralized location to maintain and find information regarding data within the department. Internal to AAFC, the objective of the AAFC Data Catalogue is to promote increased data and information discovery, sharing, awareness, transparency, and collaboration within the department and to better inform decision-making.</p>  

<p>Aside from the benefits within the department, the AAFC Data Catalogue supports the publishing of data on the Open Data Portal as part of the Government of Canada’s Open Government initiatives. By working in the open and making information available to the public, it increases accountability and transparency and provides opportunities for meaningful engagement with clients and stakeholders. Increased trust and public involvement help shape the way the government works and serves the Canadian public.</p> 

<h5>Q: What are the benefits of the data inventory? </h5>

<p>A: The benefits to the AAFC branches and the department in developing an inventory are:</p> 

	<ul><li>making AAFC information and data easier to find and use by everyone</li> 

	<li>enabling access to a wealth of AAFC data that can help you plan and make decisions </li>

	<li>increasing the potential value and impact of AAFC data </li>

	<li>determining the AAFC data, information and research that has value for the public </li>

	<li>aligning the AAFC with the Open by Default position of the Government of Canada (GC).</li></ul> 

<h5>Q: What is metadata?</h5> 

<p>A: Metadata is information about the data or dataset. In order to provide context, improve discovery and reuse and to better understand the contents, metadata is needed to describe each dataset record that is published.</p> 

<p>A metadata record is created for each dataset including a link to the location of the dataset. For example, for a dataset, the metadata could include a brief description of the dataset, supplementary information as how the data was collected, transformed, the date the data was created, the data steward email, the format of datasets and its fields, the timeframe of the collection of data, how often the dataset is updated, data quality notes or any other specifics that would benefit a user of the data.</p> 

<h5>Q: Who can use the AAFC Data Catalogue?</h5> 

<p>A: The AAFC Data Catalogue is available for search and discovery to all authenticated users on the AAFC network. Users who are responsible for sharing and published data need additional privileges to create or maintain records within the AAFC Data Catalogue. Work is on-going at AAFC to further define processes to approve additional privileges within the AAFC Data Catalogue to allow a user to manage data catalogue records within their branches. For more information, please contact our AAFC Open Government mailbox:</p> 

<p><a href="mailto:aafc.opengovernment-gouvernementouvert.aac@agr.gc.ca">aafc.opengovernment-gouvernementouvert.aac@agr.gc.ca</a></p>

<h5>Q: Can data be restricted to staff within my branch? </h5>

<p>A. Entries in the AAFC Data Catalogue are intended to be discovered by all users of the AAFC Data Catalogue, but access to the dataset resource itself can be managed outside the AAFC Data Catalogue, in the same manner access to the data is currently managed. Please consider making data accessible and available if you are entering information about the dataset within the AAFC Data Catalogue.</p> 

<h5>Q: Can I use the AAFC Data Catalogue to publish information to the Open Data Portal? </h5>

<p>A: The AAFC Data Catalogue can be used to publish information to the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) Open Data Portal by AAFC users with Edit privileges within the AAFC Data Catalogue.  If all approvals to release the information are completed including ensuring privacy, confidentiality, security and ownership concerns are addressed and proper sign-off is complete, the AAFC Data Catalogue Add a Dataset function allows the user to create an Open Data dataset.  Once all approvals are complete, flags within the AAFC Data Catalogue can set to “Ready to Publish” and an automated process will send the dataset record details and the target location of the dataset to the TBS Open Data Registry for publishing on the Open Data Portal. Editors must ensure that all data quality issues are resolved as much as possible before publishing and that supporting documents describing the datasets are included in the AAFC Data Catalogue resources to ensure these are also published to the TBS Open Data Portal.</p> 

<h5>Q: What criteria make data eligible for publishing to the Open Data portal? </h5>

<p>A: The data must be managed by AAFC for AAFC to have the authority to publish it. It must also have business value, which means the information is of use to AAFC, other government departments, and the Canadian public. Finally, the data must be eligible for publication, meaning that it is free from restrictions based on ownership, privacy, confidentiality or security issues, and releasing the information will not cause harm to individuals, the AAFC, or to the Canadian government.</p>  

<h5>Q: What are the steps to publish a dataset to the Open Data Portal?</h5> 

<p>A. The steps required to publish a dataset to the Open Data Portal depend on a number of factors.  The following outlines some key considerations:</p> 

	<ul><li> The dataset must meet all open requirements and have formal approval and sign-off by the Information Management Senior Official (currently the Assistant Deputy Minister of Information Systems Branch) confirming that all privacy, confidentiality, security or ownership considerations have been addressed. </li> 
	<li>Additional supporting documentation is required to supplement all datasets released to the Open Data Portal and data quality issues must be resolved as best as possible.</li>

	<li>The dataset location must be accessible to the public; this can be accomplished in a number of ways, however, there are limitations depending on the AAFCs capacity on their external servers, and TBSs restrictions for file uploads.</li> 

	<li>When publishing information to the Open Data Portal using the functionality with the AAFC Data Catalogue, it is important to understand there are templates and approvals required as part of the process.</li></ul>
